Ideas for originallity.


Japanese/Anime style High school Battle academy.
Players enter the world near the Shizuoka Academy, the school is run by gangs of stundents with a ranked hierarchy based on fighting ability and Ori "magic"

Ori magic are reincarnated god souls that people are born with, these god souls give the person unnatrual abilitys.

Maybe the day/night cycle could come in handy there dude.
About school only being opened at day time
and you can do activities and stuff there to level up
But then outside the school is a city you can do stuff in
What if instead of random abilitys, the student starts off just like any other new student or maybe even a "transfer student" but from being at the academy doing small things here and there he/she gains an ability from the missions or even side quest they do, that would give the possibility to even make rare abilitys for players to have.
Like if it's a side mission to find a cat that only gives like 20% exp..... lol but if you do it a certain way you can get a bad ass fighting ability
Maybe there could be several schools that a person, once they've played for a while, could choose from.
And every now and again, these schools host tournaments for their fighters to fight in
And each school has something different about them
like one is ruled like a dictatorship with strength being the only thing in the school
one excels in other shit
scheduled classes in school for a person to go to
RP wise
Like a real school with presence and everything, but with magic and brawling and shit xD
And high scoring students getting new & maybe even better fighting/magic abilitys.
Kind of like making there high school rank a real threat to others
Those are the ideas lol
